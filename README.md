# My First NFT Smart Contract

This is my first completed solidity project after learning the basics of solidity and ERC721. I'm using Beanz's (Azuki) metadata for the pictures on every token because i really like the art. You can mint, you can stake, and also sell them on the beanz marketplace.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
